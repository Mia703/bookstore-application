# PanelSync

PanelSync is a book-tracking application designed to help users monitor their reading progress. It allows users to authenticate their information, search, and filter for books and save or delete books they are currently reading. PanelSync aims to provide a seamless and enjoyable experience for literature enthusiasts by offering a centralised platform to organise and enhance their reading journey. PanelSync was built as a full-stack application using Next.js and React for the front-end, Firebase for authentication, and Supabase for the database.

Note: This project was created for the express purpose to serve as the final project for the course ICT 4300: Web Systems and Information. Developed to meet the specific requirements of the assignment, any data collected will be erased upon the conclusion of the course on March 16th, 2024, and the project's database has been frozen since then.
