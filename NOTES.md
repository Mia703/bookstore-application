## HTML Notes

The <main> tag specifies the main content of a document. The content inside the <main> element should be unique to the document. It should not contain any content that is repeated across documents such as sidebars, nav links, copyright information, site logos, and/or search forms.

There cannot be more than one <main> element in a document.
