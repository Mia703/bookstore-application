# Development Notes

1. Add project to github, don't worry about hosting it just yet - done
2. start on the navigation and page routing: [Page Routing in Next JS](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/linking-and-navigating)

- You can create your first page by adding [name].js file inside of the `app` directory.
- JS, JSX, and TSX file extensions can be used for pages
- Pages are server components by default but can be set to a client component
  - [Creating Client Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components)
- [Linking Pages in Navigation](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/linking-and-navigating)

3. [Creating HTML forms](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms)

- [Creating Your first Form](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Your_first_form)
- On page refresh, clear inputs
- How do I show what's being typed in the password input

With the label associated correctly with the input via its for attribute (which contains the input element's id attribute), a screen reader will read out something like "Name, edit text".

There is another way to associate a form control with a label â€” nest the form control within the label, implicitly associating it.

The main tag specifies the main content of a document. The content inside the main element should be unique to the document. It should not contain any content that is repeated across documents such as sidebars, nav links, copyright information, site logos, and/or search forms.

There cannot be more than one main element in a document.
